i need to get the data in steps of a year each the insert into the server

i have retrieved and saved the data successfully in the mongo db server.

- Implement the buttons for updating data from macro trends and plotting of graphs
- With the plotting of graphs, the user will be asked:
    - Overview options,
    - Column options (they can only plot one at a time from the columns),
    - Select the stock name for the desired plotting
    - period will not be asked because the data starts from a recent date

- I will create a new model for the different types of tables and just store the column headers as array lists
